SUMMARY:
The Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate maps were first introduced by FEMA back in 2013, the first time the maps had been updated since the 1980s. But that doesn't mean much to residents who say they've never had to face a flood, and definitely aren't prepared in the event their neighborhood does face rising waters.
